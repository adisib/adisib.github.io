					<h1> What is DRM? </h1>
				</section>


                <section>
					<h2> Definition </h2>
					<p>
						The definition of DRM could be any one of the following, depending on if you want to define it by its goal or its implementation.
                        
                        <li> Server Software to enable secure distribution, or disable illegal distribution, of paid content. </li>
                        <li> The description, identification, trade, protection, monitoring, and tracking of all forms of usage of assets. </li>
					</p>

                <section>
					<h2> What does DRM apply to? </h2>
					<p>
						While DRM applies to all forms of digital content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most notably it is used when referring to Video Games, Music and Movies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It also applies to books, television, and various computer software.
					</p>
				</section>
                
                <section>
					<h2> Some examples of DRM </h2>
					<p> 
                        Of course video games are the best example.
                        
                        <li> CD Keys and Activation Codes </li>
                        <li> Limited number of installs </li>
                        <li> Constant internet connection </li>
					</p>
				</section>


                <section>
					<h1> Why the Controversy? </h1>
                    <p>
                        It depends on your perspective.
                    </p>

					<h1> The Consumer Perspective </h1>
				</section>


                <section>
					<h2> DRM is Annoying </h2>
					<p> 
                        I've personally known people who pirated games after buying them just to get past the DRM.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ubisoft attempted to learn if people pirate to avoid DRM by not having DRM on a Price of Peria game (but never commented on the results).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now things like a DDoS attack can now stop you from playing a single player game.
					</p>

				</section>
                
                <section>
					<h2> DRM Prevents Ownership </h2>
					<p> 
                        Often DRM means you are not buying a product, but the right to borrow the product.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many people pirate games just as a point of owernship, that they can do whatever they want with it.
					</p>
				</section>
                
                <section>
					<h2> DRM Wastes time and money that could be spent improving product </h2>
                    <p>
                        If DRM is that ineffective, why put so much time and money into an annoyance when that time and money could have made a better product.
					</p>

                <section>
					<h2> DRM Saves money </h2>
					<p> 
                        Is piracy being done mostly by people who can't afford what they pirate?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Humble bundle, which sells games at a "pay whatever you want" price estimated that 25% of their games were pirated.
					</p>

                <section>
					<h2> DRM Protects Property </h2>
					<p> 
                        People develop to feed their family. By preventing people from just taking things the easy way, it helps to protect that property.
                    </p>
				</section>
                
                <section>
					<h2> DRM Prevents people from breaking the law </h2>
					<p> 
                        One article from Columbia University found that about 45% of U.S. citizens pirate at least casually (although they buy about 30% more digital music and displayed a higher willingness to pay for things).
                    </p>
                    <aside class="notes">

                        But really they only care about the "DRM Saves Money" part.

					<h1> The SMALL Buisness Perspective </h1>

                <section>
					<h2> Piracy Is Inevitable </h2>
					<p> 
                        DRM is bypassed extremely quickly. One DRM that was supposed to be very strong was requiring constant internet access, but it took no more than a month before the authentication server was emulated.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        No reason to waste money on DRM if people are still going to pirate things. It can only inconvinience people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to Guillaume Rambourg, managing director at Good Old Games, "DRM solves piracy like a bag of concrete solves hunger."
                    </p>
				</section>
                
                <section>
					<h2> Piracy actually isn't all that bad </h2>
					<p> 
                        Many independent developers believe that "You will never kill piracy, and piracy will never kill you."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        People pirating their games actually helps to expand their audience, so more people can experience the game and share it with others. It also helps to catch the eyes of consumers by advertising that they don't have annoying DRM.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        Piracy is still bad, and you should pay so indie developers can feed their children, but it isn't pure evil that will destroy them.
                    </p>

                <section>
					<h2> Its not about the money </h2>
					<p> 
                        Many video game developers and music artists have stated that they prefer people pirating their content and enjoying it, rather than not being able to enjoy it at all.
					</p>
                    <p>
                        They find fulfilment from people enjoying their stuff.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Weird Al" Yankovic offered a free download for a song title "Don't Download This Song" which makes fun of piracy being evil.
                    </p>

					<h2> And now some quotes from indie developers</h2>
				</section>


                <section>
                    <p>
                        According to Tommy Refenes, creator of Super Meat Boy, "As a forward thinking developer who exists in the present, I realize and accept that a pirated copy of a digital game does not equate to money being taken out of my pocket. Team Meat shows no loss in our year end totals due to piracy and neither should any other developer."

                    <p>
                        Jonatan Söderström, developer of Hotlime Miami had been deliberately giving support (bugfixes and troubleshooting) to people who downloaded his game from pirate bay instead of purchasing it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He said, "I don't really want people to pirate Hotline Miami, but I understand if they do. I've been broke the last couple of months. It sucks."

                        Indie Game developer Jeff Vogel wrote a blog post called "Sometimes It's OK To Steal My Games".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Because, when I'm being honest with myself, which happens sometimes, I have to admit that piracy is not an absolute evil. That I do get things out of it, even when I'm the one being ripped off."

                        More quotes about DRM from Jeff Vogel:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Whenever you find yourself starting a sentence with, "I don't want people to pirate my game, so I am going to ..." you are very close to making a big mistake."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Might as well have just made a big pile of money and set it on fire. At least we would have gotten the warmth."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Want to know how switching to undefended pdf files affected sales of hint books? It didn't. The sales rate was practically unchanged. Know what that means? All those years humping around boxes of hint books, all those thousands of dollars sent to printers, all those slaughtered trees, all wasted. All because I was scared of people pirating my lousy hint book."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Once you have any barrier in place at all, you'll get your payment from all the honest people, the people who know that, if nobody pays, you won't make more awesome games for them. Anything beyond that will inconvenience your paying customers and do little to nothing to prevent piracy.
It took a long time for me to learn this. Too long. And, whenever I start to forget, I look at the monolith of boxes of old hint books gathering dust in my garage."
                    </p>
